Code for paper: [Robustification of Natural Language Proof Generation with Verifier Guided Search](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vUduEdXeKTVX9_o775FHuJebeeyBRM8U/view)

This is joint work with Kevin Huang and Bryan Wang and served as the final project for [COS484](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/cos484/) at Princeton. This was reproduction of the paper [Generating Natural Language Proofs with Verifier-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12443), with various ablation studies and extensions. Look at [NLProofS](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/NLProofS) for original source code and running instructions. Here is the accompanying [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G18xBA-CVPlS40JX_WzNwH1-BkJ16fmh/view?usp=sharing)
